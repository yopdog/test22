*We, the Citizens of the Free Republic of Liberland, in order to secure Liberty, Life and Property, for ourselves and future generations, do ordain and establish the Constitution of the Free Republic of Liberland, attempting a harmonious consensus for the benefit of all those willing to assume responsibility over the course of their lives. Being aware of a long and shameful list of governments’ trespasses to the Rights of the sovereign Individuals, we hereby declare that the United Cantons governing the Free Republic of Liberland shall first and foremost respect the Bill of Rights and exercise power in good faith in order to secure the human rights which we consider inherent in all human beings.*
